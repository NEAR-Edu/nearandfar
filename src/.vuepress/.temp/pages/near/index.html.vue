<ul>
<li>
<p>not all blockchains are alike</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NEAR</strong> is a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain</p>
<ul>
<li>layer 2(L2) blockchains use architecture of existing blockchains
<ul>
<li>Polygon is built on top of Ethereum, which is a layer 1 blockchain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NEAR is built from the ground up
<ul>
<li>NEAR has its own chain with its own rules and architecture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of <strong>PoW</strong> to create trust, NEAR uses Proof of Stake(<strong>PoS</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PoS</strong> is humans validating transactions, and staking a large amount of money that they will be honest about it
<ul>
<li>validators can earn historical returns on their staking</li>
<li>it's cheaper to tell the truth than to lie</li>
<li>validators get &quot;kicked&quot; off the network if they don't follow certain rules</li>
<li>PoS is CARBON NEUTRAL üåé ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
