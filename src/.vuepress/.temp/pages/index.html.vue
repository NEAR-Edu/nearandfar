<p><em>We often use the internet and web interchangeably, but in fact these are different things.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The internet&quot; refers to the <em>infrastructure</em>
<ul>
<li><strong>a network of networks</strong> with rules for communicating, which keeps the web accessible at all times.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Once we start talking about browsers and web pages, we are in the domain of the modern web.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>You've heard of servers, but when we talk about using those servers to access and share information, we can start to see the differences between infrastructure and how it's used:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the internet (infrastructure) = highway</li>
<li>the web (information) = rush hour, and billboards, and buses - oh my!</li>

<p><em>Now that we understand that visiting a web site(Web2.0) is different than the WiFi(Internet) that brought it to your device(computer), we can start to imagine other ways to connect to each other. That's exactly what Web3.0, or Web3, is doing. It's re-imagining the web!</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When we talk about the “open web” we are talking about a system in which users have both freedom and transparency. As opposed to the &quot;closed&quot; systems used by certain governments to limit free access to information, the open web is designed to be a cooperative effort among a community of users and builders</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why is Web3 so powerful and important? Because it has the ability to side-step centralized power structures that govern the internet. Web3 is all about open access to information with a level of privacy not attainable previously. Getting around Big Brother is a pretty big deal, isn’t it?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Why is it called Web3? Today, Web3 generally refers to a type of network (of networks) that is still accessed through the existing internet, but with very different rules. Until Web3 fully breaks away from centralization, we can think of it and its infrastructure as another type of highway (like web2.0), but one where the toll roads pay YOU!</em></p>

<p><em>If Web3 is a decentralized network, then what are the rules of engagement?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>It's an exciting time for Web3. By now you've seen dozens of ads that mention cryptocurrency. You may have scratched your head at whatever an NFT is, or perhaps gawked at the idea of pixel art selling for millions of dollars in “imaginary” money with silly names like Dogecoin, Ethereum, or even NEAR.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>There’s a ton of activity in the Web3 space, but does one actually use it like you use the internet today?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Decentralized networks can pretty much make up their own rules of engagement, so long as the outside world can access the information passing through them.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>NEAR Protocol is exactly that - it's a system of distributed networks with its own rules, or <strong>protocol</strong>, for communicating.</em></p>
